# Clan-Creator
An example of what you would use to create clans within games, or such

It provides the basic functions of how you would handle a clan system.  
The information is stored in a database (mysql).

Lots of more features can be implemented in a full version such as leaving clans rather
than deleting them as a whole, leadership of who creating the clans, who can delete clans,
and such.  This is just a demo of the possibilities that are usually possible.
